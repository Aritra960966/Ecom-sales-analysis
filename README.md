# Sales Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing a sales dataset to extract valuable insights and perform various data analyses. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/target-dataset?select=products.csv) and includes information about customers, orders, and products.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this analysis were to:

1. Perform data extraction and cleaning.
2. Execute a range of SQL and Python queries to analyze the data.
3. Visualize the results to gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

## Data Source

The dataset is available at: [Kaggle Target Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/target-dataset?select=products.csv).

## Queries and Analysis

### Basic Queries

1. **List all unique cities where customers are located.**
   - Retrieve a list of cities with unique customer locations.

2. **Count the number of orders placed in 2017.**
   - Determine the total number of orders that were placed in the year 2017.

3. **Find the total sales per category.**
   - Calculate the total sales for each product category.

4. **Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments.**
   - Compute the proportion of orders that were paid through installments.

5. **Count the number of customers from each state.**
   - Count the number of customers based on their respective states.

### Intermediate Queries

1. **Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018.**
   - Determine the number of orders for each month in the year 2018.

2. **Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.**
   - Compute the average number of products ordered, categorized by the customer's city.

3. **Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.**
   - Assess the contribution of each product category to the overall revenue.

4. **Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased.**
   - Analyze the relationship between the price of a product and its purchase frequency.

5. **Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue.**
   - Compute the total revenue for each seller and rank them accordingly.

### Advanced Queries

1. **Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.**
   - Compute the moving average of order values for each customer based on their historical orders.

2. **Calculate the cumulative sales per month for each year.**
   - Determine the cumulative sales figures for each month, segmented by year.

3. **Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.**
   - Assess the growth rate of total sales compared to the previous year.

4. **Calculate the retention rate of customers, defined as the percentage of customers who make another purchase within 6 months of their first purchase.**
   - Measure the retention rate by analyzing the proportion of customers making subsequent purchases within 6 months of their initial purchase.

5. **Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.**
   - Find the top three customers with the highest spending for each year.

## Technologies Used
